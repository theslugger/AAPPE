# AAPPE
This repository contains the source code for AAPPE (Amino Acid Pair Positional Encoding), a deep learning-based model for predicting protein-ligand binding affinity. The model leverages amino acid pair positional encoding to enhance feature representation and improve prediction accuracy.

The primary focus of AAPPE is to incorporate spatial and sequential information of amino acids within a protein structure while efficiently capturing ligand interactions. The model is trained on publicly available binding affinity datasets and validated through rigorous performance evaluations.
